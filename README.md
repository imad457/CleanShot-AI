## 🛡️ What is CleanShot Pro Ultimate?

CleanShot Pro Ultimate is an advanced image preprocessing tool designed to  
**disrupt AI-based fingerprinting** while keeping the image visually identical  
to the human eye.

It adds **minimal adversarial perturbations**, removes **all metadata**,  
and applies subtle transformations that degrade AI detectors without  
destroying image quality.

This project is part of the field known as:

### **Adversarial Image Perturbation (AIP)**  
(AI vs AI privacy protection)

---

## ✨ Key Features


### ✔ Minimal & high-quality adversarial noise  
Weak but strategically placed noise to confuse ML models.

### ✔ FFT mid-frequency perturbations  
AI detectors rely heavily on mid-band patterns.

### ✔ HSV Color Preservation  
Maintains natural colors — no ugly distortions.

### ✔ Metadata removal  
Output PNG contains **zero EXIF** or camera fingerprints.

### ✔ Strong presets  
- `light` → subtle anti-AI  
- `medium` → balanced  
- `strong` → maximum AI fingerprint disruption  

### ✔ Multiprocessing for fast batch processing  
Process entire folders using all CPU cores.

### ✔ 100% compatible (no extra heavy libraries)  
No `pywt` or deep-learning dependencies.

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy

Python version:

Python 3.7+ (Linux, macOS, Windows)


---

🚀 Usage

Process a single image:

python3 cleanshot_pro.py input.jpg

Choose strength:

python3 cleanshot_pro.py input.jpg --preset medium
python3 cleanshot_pro.py input.jpg --preset strong

Process an entire folder:

python3 cleanshot_pro.py images/ --preset strong --out cleaned/

Use all CPU cores:

python3 cleanshot_pro.py images/ -t 0

Custom output directory:

python3 cleanshot_pro.py input.jpg --out protected/


---

🗂️ Output

All processed images are saved as:

cleanshot_<preset>_<original_name>.png

Examples:

cleanshot_light_photo1.png
cleanshot_strong_profile.png


These PNGs contain:

No EXIF

No device metadata

No camera information

No GPS

Modified luminance fingerprint

Distorted mid-frequency signature
